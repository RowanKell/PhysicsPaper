Outline:

***Stuff to add/explain***

1. Explain cross sections before diving into the definition of the cross sections and their use in asymmetry calculations
   1. Make sure to figure out / explain the significance of asymmetries

**Notes:**

1. **Start from textbook, then introduce the field (QCD and scattering)**
2. **With heavy math - do it the way Glenn did it during class **
   1. **If needed, skip and leave a reference**
   2. **If doable, include the math**
   3. Supplement with a reference
   4. *Probably include asymmetries*
3. **Figures are valuable - make sure to include feynman diagram for SIDIS, quark model evolution, potentially plots**

1. Introduction: Outline the motivation, the purpose, and the content of the paper
   1. Over the past summer and throughout this semester I have had the opportunity to work on a particle physics research project. My project concerns the validity of TMD factorization in the Semi-Inclusive deep inelastic scattering  (SIDIS) at CLAS12, a detector at Jefferson Lab. Specifically, I have worked on calculating SIDIS kinematics from CLAS12 data (and simulation) that can be used to calculate a quantity called affinity that estimates how well certain factorization schemes describe the QCD physics occuring in SIDIS. My project is tiny part of the giant global effort to describe the dynamics and structure of nucleons: the proton and neutron. This effort was jump started in 1988 when the European Muon Collaboration published the first results of $g_1^p$, a quantity that describes how much of the proton's spin is made up from valence quark spin. The simplest quark model of the proton describes the nucleon as a collection of three quarks bound together by nuclear gluon, where the proton's 1/2 spin is the sum of the spins of the 1/2 spin quarks. SIDIS experiments have forced physicists to create more complex nucleon models where the three valence quarks orbit through a sea of quark-antiquark pairs. The proton spin can thus originate in parts from valence quark spin and angular momentum, sea quark spin and angular momentum, and even gluon spin and angular momentum. This paper aims to introduce the experiments that began and continued these efforts in proton spin studies, explain the impact of SIDIS studies on the field, and connect the physics back to the basics of spin taught in Modern Physics courses
   2. First the paper will provide an overview of spin for elementary particles and how the quantity can be used to describe (word for not elementary) particles. I will then discuss the Bjorken and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules and their relevence to nucleon spin, as well as the experiments that tested their validity. These experiments lead into the current advances concerning the proton spin puzzle where the paper concludes.

1. Section 1: What is spin and why is it important
   1. Electron spin: recap of what we learned in class
   2. How does electron spin relate / differ from nucleon spin?
2. Section 2: Beginnings of nucleon spin theory
   1. Assumptions about the makeup of the nucleon's spin
   2. Bjorken Sum Rule (and Ellis Jaffe sum rule?)
   3. First EMC experiment testing the sum rules
   4. Further experiments with SLAC, CERN, SMC
3. Section 3: Proton spin puzzle from then on

Unplaced parts that I can explain now but need to place in a natural place later

1. What is SIDIS?
   1. Inelastic scattering refers to experiments where a particle (typically in a particle accelerator like the LHC or RHIC) collides with another particle and through its momentum transfer "breaks" the particle into different particles. Electrons and muons (leptons) are typically accelerated to high energies and directed at target nucleons to make them run into each other. Inelastic scattering differs from elastic scattering as the target particle remains whole in the latter experiments. These experiments are referred to as deep if the square of the momentum transfered from the lepton to to the nucleon, $Q^2$ is large. Thus we have Deep Inelastic Scattering, which describes the experiments performed by the EMC and SLAC at the beginning of the proton spin crisis. These experiments are described as inclusive as they detect the scattered lepton, but not the remnants of the target proton. Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering refers to experiments where the detectors capture the scattered lepton in addition to at least one high energy hadron. 
2. Color confinement - why we can't measure quarks or gluons but only hadrons and how this impacts research of proton structure (makes it hardddd)
